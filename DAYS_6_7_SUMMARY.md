# Days 6-7 Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Objective Achieved
Extended the Knowledge Hub beyond file uploads by adding multi-source connectors and polishing into a demo-ready product.

## ✅ Deliverables Completed

### 1. Multi-Source Ingestion Pipeline
- **API Endpoint**: `POST /ingest` with support for GitHub and RSS sources
- **GitHub Connector**: Fetches README.md and documentation files from repositories
- **RSS Connector**: Imports recent articles from news feeds and blogs
- **Worker Jobs**: `ingest_github.py` and `ingest_rss.py` for background processing
- **Reuses Pipeline**: All ingested content goes through parse → chunk → embed → tag → summarize

### 2. Comprehensive Dashboard UI
- **Dashboard Page**: `/dashboard` with real-time document overview
- **Document Listing**: Complete table with ID, filename, status, chunks, tags, summary
- **Integrated Ingestion**: Built-in form for GitHub/RSS ingestion
- **Navigation**: Added site-wide navigation header
- **Real-time Updates**: Uses SWR for automatic refresh every 3 seconds

### 3. Enhanced API Endpoints
- **GET /documents**: Returns all documents with metadata
- **POST /ingest**: Multi-source ingestion endpoint
- **Extended DocumentResponse**: Added created_at field for better tracking

### 4. Dedicated Ingestion Interface
- **Ingest Page**: `/ingest` with focused UI for external source imports
- **Source Selection**: GitHub and RSS with example URLs
- **User-friendly**: Clear instructions and status feedback

### 5. UI/UX Polish
- **Professional Navigation**: Site-wide header with all key pages
- **Improved Homepage**: Quick action cards and feature highlights
- **Consistent Styling**: Tailwind CSS throughout with proper spacing and colors
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Status Indicators**: Visual feedback for document processing states
